### Quick-insertion outperforms all the other algorithms

```cmd
Enter the array size:1000
Enter the k:10

generated array:
omited because it was too large!

quicksort sort:
running time: 0.0003389
result:
omited because it was too large!

isSorted: true

merge sort sort:
running time: 0.0004021
result:
omited because it was too large!

isSorted: true
